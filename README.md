# java-code-along

This is the official repository for the Getting Started with Java for Data code along.

## Setup

Clone this repository on your local machine and open it using IntelliJ, which can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/other.html.

If you don't have `git` installed, you can install it following the guide here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git. Follow the instructions based on the platform (Windows/Mac/Linux).

After you've opened the repository in IntelliJ, you can open a terminal window and create a new branch using the following command: `git checkout -b <your-name>`.

If you have any issues and you would like me to take a look at the code, feel free to push your changes to the branch using:

```
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push -u origin <your-name>
```

## Solving the exercises

We'll start with a short introduction on general concepts in Java and then we'll solve the exercises. At the end we should get a program that reads CSV weather data from the `weather_data.csv` file and computes some statistics on it. It's based to solve the exercises in order, since they build on top of each other.
